  abstract = {The fleet assignment problem (FAP) deals with assigning aircraft types, each having a different capacity, to the scheduled flights, based on equipment capabilities and availabilities, operational costs, and potential revenues. An airline’s fleeting decision highly impacts its revenues, and thus, constitutes an essential component of its overall scheduling process. However, due to the large number of flights scheduled each day, and the dependency of the FAP on other airline processes, solving the FAP has always been a challenging task for the airlines. In this paper, we present a tutorial on the basic and enhanced models and approaches that have been developed for the FAP, including: (1) integrating the FAP with other airline decision processes such as schedule design, aircraft maintenance routing, and crew scheduling; (2) proposing solution techniques that include additional considerations into the traditional fleeting models, such as considering itinerary-based demand forecasts and the recapture effect, as well as investigating the effectiveness of alternative approaches such as randomized search procedures; and (3) studying dynamic fleeting mechanisms that update the initial fleeting solution as departures approach and more information on demand patterns is gathered, thus providing a more effective way to match the airline’s supply with demand. We also discuss future research directions in the fleet assignment arena.}

  abstract = {Traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one typical combinatorial optimization problem. Ant colony optimization (ACO) is useful for solving discrete optimization problems whereas the performance of ACO depends on the values of parameters. The hybrid symbiotic organisms search (SOS) and ACO algorithm (SOS–ACO) is proposed for TSP. After certain parameters of ACO are assigned, the remaining parameters can be adaptively optimized by SOS. Using the optimized parameters, ACO finds the optimal or near-optimal solution and the complexity for assigning ACO parameters is greatly reduced. In addition, one simple local optimization strategy is incorporated into SOS–ACO for improving the convergence rate and solution quality. SOS–ACO is tested with different TSP instances in TSPLIB. The best solutions are within 2.33% of the known optimal solution. Compared with some of the previous algorithms, SOS–ACO finds the better solutions under the same preconditions. Finally, the performance of SOS–ACO is analyzed according to the changes of some ACO parameters. The experimental results illustrate that SOS–ACO has good adaptive ability to various values of these parameters for finding the competitive solutions.}

  abstract = {A dynamic programming based algorithm for the crew scheduling problem. There are many papers concerned with the crew scheduling problem in the literature. Most of the research literature views the crew scheduling problem as equivalent of the set covering problem, or as equivalent to the set partitioning problem. In this paper we highlight the fact that the crew scheduling problem is a separate and distinct problem. This leads naturally to a dynamic programming formulation of the problem. Following on from this formulation a new lower bound for the crew scheduling problem is developed based upon dynamic programming. Incorporating this lower bound into a tree search procedure we are able to solve to proven optimality a number of problems involving a relatively large number of tasks. In this paper we consider the crew scheduling problem, that is the problem of assigning K crews to tasks with fixed start and finish times such that each crew does not exceed a limit on the total time it can spend working. This problem is formulated as a problem of finding K time limit constrained vertex disjoint paths which visit all vertices on a network. A lower bound for the problem is found via dynamic programming. This lower bound is improved via a Lagrangean based penalty procedure and subgradient optimisation. Computational results are given for a number of randomly generated problems involving between 50 and 500 tasks.}

Computational results for real road networks with up to 292 visiting places are reported, as well as for classical problems of the literature with up to 120 cities.

The scope of this paper is to close this gap by providing a comprehensive survey on mathematical formulations, solution approaches and latest advances regarding the GTSP. The paper is organized around the following issues: problem definition, variations and related problems, real-life applications of the GTSP, mathematical formulations, solution approaches designed for solving the investigated problem, datasets, computational results and comparative analysis of the performance of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we discuss certain open problems and potential research directions.}

The comparison of such approximation with a Monte Carlo simulation shows both the accuracy and the efficiency of the deterministic approximation, with a mean percentage gap around 2% and a reduction of the computational times of two orders of magnitude.}

abstract="Monte-Carlo algorithms and their UCT-like successors have recently shown remarkable promise for Go-playing programs. We apply some of these same algorithms to an Amazons-playing program. Our experiments suggest that a pure MC/UCT type program for playing Amazons has little promise, but by using strong evaluation functions we are able to create a hybrid MC/UCT program that is superior to both the basic MC/UCT program and the conventional minimax-based programs. The MC/UCT program is able to beat Invader, a strong minimax program, over 80{\%} of the time at tournament time controls.",
